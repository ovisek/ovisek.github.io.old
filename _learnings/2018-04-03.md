title: "Day 1: April 3, Tuesday"

**Today's Progress**:
- Started with an introduction to AWS IAM services. 
- Configured SSH access to EC2 instance (AWS Linux AMI) via Putty on Windows
- Created new role and assigned to instance
- Installed boto3 

**Thoughts** 
I would like to get a clear picture how the SSH connections work - the maths and concepts behind assymetric keys / public / private keys. This may lead to digressing from the actual learning objectives , but I feel spending sometime on it is worth it.
Also, I had started on getting an overview of the various AWS services and concepts - few topics are yet to be covered. This isn't a exhaustive study but a general overview - will take up each of these one at a time while working on these from a programers perspective.
Atleast as of now I would like to be clear with all the available services and their use cases.
